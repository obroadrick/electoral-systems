# The standard MFW picks C, and locks in to w=C r=D (this is stable).
# (But it could just as well have locked into w=A r=D (same by symmetry).)
# So winning counts just have C winning, and A, B, D as no-shows.
# Interesting that not all members of Smith set end up as winners.
#
# Here MFW variant picks D, even though he is not in Smith set
# When A is winner, D gains 29, but B and C gain 10 and 20 only.

A B C D (10)
B C A D (10)
C A B D (10)
D (29)
