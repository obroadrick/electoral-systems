# illustrates use of parameter setting ability
# next line shows how to set parameter named "missing_preferred_less"
# which causes routine that computes preference matrix to do nothing
# about candidates that are not listed.
# (The default is that they are treated as less preferred than those listed.)
# This gives an easy way to enter a preference matrix.
