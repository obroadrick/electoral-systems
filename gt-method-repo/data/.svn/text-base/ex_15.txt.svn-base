# playing around to see what happens with MB-MFW with two cycles,
# one of which is preferred to the other

## missing_preferred_less false

# first cycle
A B (2)
B C (20)
C A (200)

# second cycle
D E (1)
E F (10)
F D (100)

# prefer second cycle to first cycle
# note all alternatives listed, since with missing_preferred_less false,
# otherwise elements in DEF are tied with ABC, which means there are
# edges both ways for Smith-set computation, giving ABCDEF as Smith set
# which is not what we want...
D E F A B C (1)
